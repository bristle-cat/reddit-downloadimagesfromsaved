A simple Python script to download images from Saved posts in your account

I have loads of saved posts from a subreddit featuring pictures of military aircraft. I don't like to save just the images, because I lose the context of the post's title which usually identifies the type of aircraft, the country, and the year. I wrote this script to dowload the images with the post title as a description. The description is stored in a csv file with the image file name for reference.
